# GDP-forecasting-for-India-using-R
I took the raw data from Kaggle and with help of ARIMA model, I tried to forecast GDP for India for the next decade. Since the data is from 1961 to 2021, forecasting for 2022 and comparing it with the official GDP growth of 2022 gives the conclusion either my ARIMA model succeeded to meet my need.
